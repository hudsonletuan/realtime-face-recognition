# Real-time Face Recognition using Deep Learning CNN

### This Python application uses the OpenCV library and the pre-trained model VGGFace for running and training. This recognizes faces appearing on the camera and will run through the face database saved locally to display the name on the frame of the person recognized on the camera.
### This application uses PyQt for GUI.
### This application is still under finetuning, more training, and optimization for better performance.
### This model can be manually improved. When capturing faces, the user will have two options either the face is true or wrong. By selecting the option, this application will capture the face and save it to the right person's folder, then the model will have more data to train itself.

To structure the face database, you have to put each person's face images inside a folder that is labeled by their name. These folders are saved inside the folder "images/".
