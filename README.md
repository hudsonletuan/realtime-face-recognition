# Real-time Face Recognition

### This Python application uses the OpenCV library as well as pre-trained model VGGFace for running and training. This recognizes faces appearing on the camera and will run through the face database saved locally to display the name on the frame of the person recognized on the camera.
### This application uses PyQt for GUI.
### This application is still under finetuning and more training as well as optimization for better performance.

To structure the face database, you have to put each person's faces inside a folder that is labelled by their name. These folders are saved inside the folder "images/".
